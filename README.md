# Linux Programming

Welcome to the **Linux Programming** repository! This resource offers a comprehensive collection of notes, tutorials, and reference materials on Linux system programming.

## Introduction

Linux system programming involves interacting directly with the kernel, managing hardware resources, and developing low-level applications. This repository aims to be your go-to resource for understanding these concepts, blending theoretical insights with practical examples.

## Tutorials and Guides

Explore our curated tutorials and step-by-step guides on topics such as:

- **Kernel Development:** Dive into the inner workings of the Linux kernel.
- **Device Drivers:** Learn how to write and manage device drivers.
- **System Calls & Interrupts:** Understand the mechanisms that allow user-space applications to interact with the kernel.
- **Memory Management & Scheduling:** Discover how Linux manages memory and processes.
- **Process & Thread Management:** Get hands-on with the creation, synchronization, and management of processes and threads.

Each tutorial is designed to simplify complex topics with clear explanations, code examples, and exercises.
